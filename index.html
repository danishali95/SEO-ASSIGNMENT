        <p>Favicon:
            A favicon is a small icon associated with a website, typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks.
            It helps users visually identify and distinguish websites when multiple tabs are open.
            For example, a website about photography might use a camera icon as its favicon.</p>
